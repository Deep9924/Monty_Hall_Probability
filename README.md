# Monty Hall User's Choice Probability  
### This python program reveals the probability of user's choice to stay with their original guess or change it  

In the gameshow the host, Monty Hall, ask the person to pick the door:  
-> Behind 1 door there is a prize (Car)  
-> Behind other 2 doors there is a goat  
-> Monty Hall opens the another door which has goat in it  
-> Then asks the person if they want to keep their choice or switch it?  
-> Person then either keeps their original decision or have a chance to change it  
-> Then Monty reveals if they won the car or not  

<b>Will the probability after revealing one door will be 50-50 for changing guess? OR  
Will the probability after revealing one door will be 66-33 for changing guess? </b>

#### As the number of times program runs increases the probability gets closer.
### The answer is it will get closer to 66-33 or 2/3 probability.
